Feature: User Login

  As a registered user
  I want to log in to the application
  So that I can access my personal dashboard

  Background:
    Given the user is on the login page

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    When the user enters a valid username and password
    And clicks the login button
    Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard
    And see a welcome message
